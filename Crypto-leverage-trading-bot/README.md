# Crypto leverage trading bot

This trading bot is designed to buy or sell assets with 20x leverage when the 13-day exponential moving average (EMA) crosses over the 50-day moving average (MA). It is primarily intended for closing positions (I used it for getting out of positions while I was sleeping) and uses the FTX API. **As you probably know, FTX is dead however APIs in all exchanges work pretty much the same.
